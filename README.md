# geometric-shapes

OOP practice with three geometric figures classes:
1) Rectangle
2) Square (the inherirts from rectangle)
3) Circle

All this classes are subclasses of Shapes (that is an abstract class)

All figures have an area, perimeter, sides length (or radius in case of the circle) a color and they can draw with 'turtle' their shape

*Also: 
1. two rectangles can perform addition maintaining the area
2. Because operation are performed with floats, results are rounded to an specified amount of decimals
